# Specification Quality Checklist: Restart Button

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items passed successfully. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**: ✓ PASS

- Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without HOW
- Written for business stakeholders (プレゼンター perspective)
- No technology stack mentioned (frameworks, libraries, etc.)
- All mandatory sections completed with detailed content

**Requirement Completeness**: ✓ PASS

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 9 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-001: "表示しなければならない", FR-002: "リセットされなければならない")
- Success criteria include specific metrics (SC-001: "50%削減", SC-002: "0.5秒以内")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no API/framework references)
- 4 acceptance scenarios for P1, 3 for P2, 3 for P3 - all well-defined
- 4 edge cases identified with specific conditions
- Scope clearly bounded to Restart button functionality
- Assumptions section documents design and implementation decisions

**Feature Readiness**: ✓ PASS

- Each functional requirement mapped to user scenarios
- User scenarios prioritized (P1/P2/P3) and independently testable
- Measurable outcomes defined for all success criteria
- Specification maintains separation from implementation (uses "システム", "ユーザー" instead of class/method names)

**Summary**: Specification meets all quality standards and is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
